Repeatable Elements
A Concrete5 plugin

This plugin installs the Repeatable Elements block to your Concrete5 installation.

The Repeatable Elements block allows for the creation of repeatable items stored within a block.  Think of it as an unordered list you can add anything too and style however you'd like.

The Repetable Elements block consists of repeatable items that can be enabled or disabled in the blocks options.  You can then add, remove, rearrange or delete any number of elements that include the enabled items.

For example, if you have created a new Repeatable Elements block and have enabled images in the options tab, each element you add to the form will allow the selection of an image.

Currently the block supports titles and images.

In process are more options that can be enabled, such as repeatable locations for showing multiple maps in one block, etc.

Its aimed at developers.

I'd like to add a third tab for choosing preset layouts for the view.

The idea is to use one block to build most on page elements found within a web design.  The agency I work for has great graphic designs constantly putting together very nice designs, but the functionality typically remains the same.  A block like this will save tremendous time if implemented correctly.
